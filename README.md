# object_detection-from-stitching-video
In this project, We have developed a Real-time object detection System. The proposed system at first captures images from two cameras covering 180 deg angle. Then, an image stitching operation has been done on the captured image. Finally, a 180 view image is created. The proposed system also detected the object in the paranormal image in real-time. The final output is shown using a URL. 
The project's starting point is the url_generate folder Insert into this folder and runs the detection_nms_v2.py file.
It will generate URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
